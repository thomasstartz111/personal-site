Prediction markets aggregate dispersed information into prices. The theory is elegant: traders with better information profit at the expense of those with worse information, pushing prices toward true probabilities. But retail markets like Polymarket—with their mix of sophisticated traders and casual participants—should exhibit exploitable inefficiencies.

I built a system to find out. Short answer: No.

## The Hypothesis

My initial thesis was straightforward: Polymarket should have arbitrage opportunities that arise from three sources:

1. **Complement mispricing** — Yes/No pairs that don't sum to $1.00
2. **Cross-market inconsistencies** — Related markets that don't price logically with each other
3. **Stale prices** — Low-attention markets that don't react quickly to new information

The first is pure arbitrage—free money if it exists. The second requires finding logical violations. The third requires speed and domain knowledge.

## Data Collection

Over 12.6 hours of continuous scanning:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Markets tracked | 3,335 |
| Price snapshots | 51,430 |
| WebSocket updates | ~57 per 30 seconds |

The system polls the Polymarket Gamma API every 30 seconds for market metadata and prices, while a WebSocket connection to the CLOB provides real-time order book updates.

## Finding 1: Complement Arbitrage Doesn't Exist

The first test was simple: for each market, check if Yes price + No price = $1.00.

**Result: 0 opportunities across 51,430 snapshots.**

Every single snapshot showed perfect pricing. The CLOB mechanism keeps complementary tokens in lockstep. This isn't surprising in hindsight—the market maker infrastructure is designed to prevent exactly this kind of arbitrage—but it eliminates the easiest edge.

## Finding 2: Cross-Market Relationships Are (Mostly) Efficient

The more interesting question: do related markets misprice relative to each other?

I tested two categories:

**Fed Rate Markets:** Multiple markets for different rate outcomes should sum to ~100%. The actual sum: 97.5%. Correctly priced within market-making spreads.

**Oscar Nominations:** Best Actor nominations have 5 slots. If you sum the "Yes" prices for all nominees, you should get approximately 500%. The actual sum: 520.6%.

The Oscar markets are 4% "overpriced" in aggregate. But Polymarket charges 2% fees, and spreads eat another 1-2%. The edge disappears after transaction costs.

## Finding 3: Low-Attention Markets Exist But Aren't Tradeable

The scanner found markets with low activity—stale prices, thin books, few trades. These look like opportunities on the surface.

The problem: spreads and depth.

Every "inefficient" market had wide spreads that eliminated any edge. You can't size positions profitably when the book has $50 of liquidity. The market makers are sophisticated—they widen spreads on illiquid markets precisely because those are the ones most likely to be mispriced.

## Why Naive Arbitrage Fails

Five factors explain the results:

1. **CLOB efficiency** — Deviations get arbitraged in milliseconds by automated traders
2. **30-second polling** — Too slow to catch fleeting opportunities
3. **2% fees** — Kills any edge under 3 cents
4. **Wide spreads** — Most markets have 5-10% bid-ask spreads
5. **Low depth** — Can't size positions profitably even when mispricings exist

## Where Alpha Might Actually Exist

| Opportunity | Viability |
|-------------|-----------|
| Simple arbitrage | Not viable |
| Mean reversion | Moves are usually information, not noise |
| Cross-market arb | Marginal (fees eat the edge) |
| Information edge | Viable if you have domain expertise |
| Event trading | Viable during price discovery |

The pattern is clear: the edge isn't in execution—it's in information. If you know something the market doesn't (which Oscar films have real buzz, which sports outcomes are mispriced, how a court ruling will go), you can profit. But that's true of any market.

## Technical Architecture

The system has four components:

**Scanner** polls 5,000+ markets every 30 seconds, storing snapshots in SQLite. **WebSocket** connects to `wss://ws-subscriptions-clob.polymarket.com/ws/market` for real-time order book updates. **Signal Engine** detects complement arbitrage, anchoring patterns, deadline pressure, and low-attention signals. **Backtest Framework** replays historical data with realistic fees, tracking Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and max drawdown.

For semantic analysis, I used local embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 via transformers.js) to cluster related markets automatically. Markets about Elon Musk, Fed rate decisions, and Oscar nominations all clustered correctly without manual labeling.

## Conclusions

Polymarket is more efficient than expected. The CLOB keeps Yes + No at exactly 100.00%. Cross-market relationships are priced within transaction costs. The obvious mispricings don't exist, and the subtle ones are too small to trade profitably.

This matches the efficient market hypothesis prediction: prediction markets aggregate information effectively, leaving little alpha for pure technical analysis. The infrastructure I built—real-time streaming, semantic clustering, backtesting—could surface opportunities. But exploiting them requires domain expertise that no scanner can provide.

The market works as designed.
